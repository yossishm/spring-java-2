âœ… **StringEscapeUtils**: Normal functionality preserved  
âœ… **Application Health**: All systems operational  
âœ… **Swagger UI**: Fully functional  

## Attack Surface Analysis

### Potential Attack Vectors (Now Mitigated)

1. **DoS via Malicious Unicode Escapes**
   - Attacker sends crafted Unicode escape sequences
   - Could cause infinite loops in vulnerable versions
   - **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Large payloads with Unicode escapes
   - Could exhaust CPU and memory resources
   - **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

3. **Web Application DoS**
   - Malicious requests to endpoints using StringEscapeUtils
   - Could deny service to legitimate users
   - **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

4. **Memory Exhaustion**
   - Repeated malicious Unicode processing
   - Could cause OutOfMemoryError
   - **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

### Attack Payloads Tested

```java
// Payload 1: Basic DoS attack
"\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u"

// Payload 2: Null character attack
"\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000"

// Payload 3: Extended DoS attack
"\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u\\u"

// Payload 4: Double escape attack
"\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u\\\\u"

// Payload 5: Large payload (30,000 characters)
StringBuilder largePayload = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    largePayload.append("\\u");
}
```
