## üöÄ **How to Generate Reports**

### **Option 1: Generate All Reports**
```bash
./generate-dotnet-reports.sh
```

This script will:
- Run tests with coverage collection
- Generate HTML coverage report
- Run security audits
- Execute Trivy security scan
- Generate code analysis reports
- Create all report files

### **Option 2: Interactive Report Viewer**
```bash
./view-dotnet-reports.sh
```

This interactive script allows you to:
- Check which reports are available
- View report previews
- Open reports in browser
- Generate missing reports

### **Option 3: Individual Commands**
```bash
# Coverage report
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
reportgenerator -reports:"TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"TestResults/CoverageReport" -reporttypes:"Html"

# Security audit
dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive > reports/dotnet/security-audit.txt

# Trivy scan
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace aquasec/trivy:latest fs /workspace > reports/dotnet/trivy-security-scan.txt
```

## üìà **GitHub Actions Reports**

### **Artifacts Generated**
The GitHub Actions workflows automatically generate and upload:

1. **Test Results Artifact**
   - Test execution results
   - Coverage reports
   - Build logs

2. **Security Reports Artifact**
   - SARIF security findings
   - Security audit results
   - Trivy scan results

### **Accessing GitHub Actions Reports**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Select a workflow run
4. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
5. Download and extract the artifacts

## üîç **Understanding Report Content**

### **Coverage Report Interpretation**
- **Green**: Covered lines
- **Red**: Uncovered lines
- **Yellow**: Partially covered branches
- **Threshold**: 80% minimum coverage required

### **Security Report Interpretation**
- **HIGH/CRITICAL**: Must be fixed immediately
- **MEDIUM**: Should be addressed soon
- **LOW**: Consider fixing when possible
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures reference

### **Code Analysis Report Interpretation**
- **Error**: Must be fixed
- **Warning**: Should be addressed
- **Info**: Best practice recommendations
- **Hidden**: Suppressed issues

## üìä **Report Integration**

### **SonarQube Integration**
Reports are automatically integrated with SonarQube:
- Coverage data from Cobertura.xml
- Security findings from SARIF
- Code analysis from build output

### **GitHub Security Tab**
Security findings are automatically uploaded:
- SARIF format for standardized display
- Integration with GitHub's security features
- Automated security alerts

### **CI/CD Quality Gates**
Reports are used for automated quality gates:
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Security vulnerability blocking
- Code quality standards enforcement

## üõ†Ô∏è **Customizing Reports**

### **Coverage Thresholds**
Edit `SpringJavaEquivalent.csproj`:
```xml
<Threshold>80</Threshold>
<ThresholdType>line</ThresholdType>
```

### **Security Severity Levels**
Modify Trivy command in scripts:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace aquasec/trivy:latest fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL /workspace
```

### **Code Analysis Rules**
Configure analyzers in `SpringJavaEquivalent.csproj`:
```xml
<AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode>
<RunAnalyzersDuringBuild>true</RunAnalyzersDuringBuild>
```

## üì± **Mobile-Friendly Reports**

The HTML coverage report is mobile-friendly and can be viewed on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile devices
- Tablets
- Embedded in documentation

## üîÑ **Automated Report Generation**

Reports are automatically generated:
- **On every push**: Full quality gate with all reports
- **On pull requests**: Quality gate with coverage and security
- **Daily**: Security scan with vulnerability updates
- **On demand**: Using the provided scripts

## üìß **Report Notifications**

Email notifications include:
- **Failure alerts**: Immediate notification with report links
- **Success summaries**: Daily/weekly quality summaries
- **Security alerts**: Immediate notification for new vulnerabilities

---

**Note**: All reports are generated in a consistent format and can be easily integrated with external tools and dashboards.
