# Corrected CVE Status Analysis

## User's Correct Observation

You are correct - I need to verify what Spring Boot 3.5.7 actually included before claiming it was vulnerable.

## What I Should Have Done

1. Check the actual dependency versions in Spring Boot 3.5.7
2. Compare those versions to the vulnerable ranges for each CVE
3. Only then determine if 3.5.7 was vulnerable or not

## CVE Vulnerable Ranges

### CVE-2025-24813 (Tomcat Path Equivalence)
- **Vulnerable**: Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34
- **Fixed in**: Tomcat 10.1.35+

### CVE-2025-55752 (Tomcat Path Traversal)  
- **Vulnerable**: Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44
- **Fixed in**: Tomcat 10.1.45+

### CVE-2025-24970 (Netty SSL/TLS)
- **Vulnerable**: Netty 4.1.91.Final through 4.1.117.Final
- **Fixed in**: Netty 4.1.118.Final+

### CVE-2025-41249 (Spring Framework)
- **Vulnerable**: Spring Framework 6.2.0-6.2.10
- **Fixed in**: Spring Framework 6.2.11+

## What I Need to Verify

1. What Tomcat version did Spring Boot 3.5.7 include?
2. What Netty version did Spring Boot 3.5.7 include?
3. What Spring Framework version did Spring Boot 3.5.7 include?

If Spring Boot 3.5.7 already included:
- Tomcat >= 10.1.35 (for CVE-2025-24813)
- Tomcat >= 10.1.45 (for CVE-2025-55752)
- Netty >= 4.1.118.Final (for CVE-2025-24970)
- Spring Framework >= 6.2.11 (for CVE-2025-41249)

Then Spring Boot 3.5.7 was **NOT vulnerable** to these CVEs.

## Apology

I apologize for making assumptions without verifying the actual versions in Spring Boot 3.5.7. The tests should verify fix status, but I should not have claimed 3.5.7 was vulnerable without checking first.
