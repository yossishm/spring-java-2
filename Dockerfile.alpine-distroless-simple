# Multi-stage build for offline/distroless deployment - Simple approach
# This version uses pre-installed Java and only removes package manager

# Stage 1: Builder with full JDK
FROM eclipse-temurin:21.0.8_9-jdk-alpine-3.22 AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY target/gs-spring-boot-docker-0.2.0.jar /build/app.jar

# Stage 2: Final runtime with minimal cleanup
FROM eclipse-temurin:21.0.8_9-jre-alpine-3.22 AS final

# Remove package manager and cache to make it distroless-like
# Keep all essential binaries for security scanning
RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /etc/apk /usr/share/man /usr/share/doc /tmp/* && \
    # Create non-root user
    addgroup -g 65532 -S nonroot && \
    adduser -u 65532 -S nonroot -G nonroot

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /build/app.jar /app/app.jar

# Set ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R nonroot:nonroot /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER nonroot:nonroot

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
