# Application Dockerfile that uses the pre-built base runtime
# This approach requires building the base runtime once, then reusing it

# Use the pre-built base runtime (build this first with Dockerfile.base-runtime)
FROM java-runtime:21-alpine-distroless AS base

# Stage 1: Builder with full JDK
FROM eclipse-temurin:21.0.8_9-jdk-alpine-3.22 AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY target/gs-spring-boot-docker-0.2.0.jar /build/app.jar

# Final stage: Use base runtime
FROM base AS final

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /build/app.jar /app/app.jar

# Set ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R nonroot:nonroot /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER nonroot:nonroot

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run application
